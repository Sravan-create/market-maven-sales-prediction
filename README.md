# Retail Sales Prediction and Analytics

## Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model for predicting seasonal trends, sales, and discount effectiveness in the retail sector. By leveraging advanced algorithms like Random Forest and other ensemble methods, the model achieves over 80% accuracy. The solution is optimized for dynamic, data-driven decision-making to help businesses enhance their profitability and resource allocation.

## Dataset

### Description

- The dataset includes historical sales data, seasonal indicators, discount details, and other key features relevant to the retail domain.
- Ensure that the dataset is in `.csv` format and contains the following columns:
  - `Date`: Date of the transaction
  - `Sales`: Sales amount
  - `Discount`: Discount percentage
  - `Season`: Seasonal category (e.g., Summer, Winter, Holiday, etc.)
  - `Category`: Product category
  - Additional custom features as needed

### Preprocessing

- Handle missing values using imputation techniques.
- Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- Normalize numerical features for better model performance.

## Results

- Achieved **80%+ accuracy** on validation datasets.
- Insights on seasonal trends and the effectiveness of discounts are visualized using heatmaps, line plots, and bar charts.
- Model performance metrics:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 250.45
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 310.78
  - **R-squared (R2):** 0.87
